// TODO tests for transforms without objects.
// Example: Root <- (T)no_obj <- (T)no_obj <- obj3
// Also all this tests need to be rewritten to unit tests, because this module tests is too difficult to understanding.

/*
|* Transform cases.
|* T - anim translate
|* R - anim rotate
|*
|* Keep in mind that the rotate animation can't be without translation animation,
|* so implementation for some test can be skipped. For example R and T|R are identical.
|*
|* The cases 1 and 5 also test algorithm which adds animation
|* translation to the objects which have only rotate animation.
|*
|* The first column is count of implemented tests for the case.
