- **Added:** Jenkins pipeline script.
- **Fixed:** Manipulators' state machine. There were some problems in the state machine 
             one of them could lead to undefined behavior it was fixed now, also

             By default all the manipulators sre **disabled now**, 
             so you must put the manipulator to the objects explicitly.
